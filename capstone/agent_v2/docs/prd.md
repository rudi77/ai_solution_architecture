# Rich CLI Tool Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Goals and Background Context

### Goals
• Replace minimal argparse CLI (53 lines) with modern Typer-based rich command interface
• Implement 7 core command groups: run, missions, tools, providers, sessions, config, and dev
• Provide extensible plugin architecture enabling third-party command group additions via entry points
• Deliver rich interactive experience with auto-completion, progress bars, colored tables, and multi-format output
• Enable hierarchical configuration management with environment variable support and file-based persistence
• Create professional developer experience with interactive shell mode, debug capabilities, and comprehensive help system
• Maintain backward compatibility with existing agent execution patterns while dramatically enhancing usability

### Background Context

The current agent_v2 platform has evolved from a simple ReAct-style execution agent into a sophisticated general-purpose problem-solving system with mission templates, multi-provider LLM support, and planned web interfaces. However, the CLI interface remains the original minimal implementation using basic argparse, creating a significant gap between the platform's powerful capabilities and developer accessibility.

This Rich CLI Tool transforms the command-line experience from a simple script runner into a modern developer platform. Built on Typer framework with Rich terminal formatting, it provides the primary interface through which developers will discover missions, manage tools, configure providers, and monitor execution. The CLI serves as both the development interface and the foundation for enterprise integrations, with a plugin architecture that enables extensibility without core modifications.

The technical architecture defines 7 command groups with 35+ individual commands, plugin discovery via Python entry points, rich progress visualization, auto-completion for all major entities, and multi-format output (table/JSON/YAML) suitable for both human consumption and programmatic integration.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

**FR1:** The CLI shall provide a main `agent` command with 7 core subcommand groups: run, missions, tools, providers, sessions, config, and dev.

**FR2:** The CLI shall support auto-completion for all commands, subcommands, mission template names, tool names, provider IDs, and session IDs.

**FR3:** The CLI shall implement plugin discovery via Python entry points, allowing third-party packages to register new command groups without modifying core CLI code.

**FR4:** The CLI shall provide rich progress visualization with spinners, progress bars, and status updates during long-running agent execution.

**FR5:** The CLI shall support multiple output formats (table, JSON, YAML, text) configurable per command via --output flag.

**FR6:** The CLI shall provide interactive parameter collection for mission templates with validation, default values, and help text.

**FR7:** The CLI shall maintain session management with ability to list, show details, resume interrupted sessions, and export session data.

**FR8:** The CLI shall provide hierarchical configuration management with file-based persistence and environment variable overrides.

**FR9:** The CLI shall include an interactive shell mode with persistent session context and command history.

**FR10:** The CLI shall provide comprehensive help system with command descriptions, examples, and parameter documentation.

**FR11:** The CLI shall support mission template management including list, show, create, edit, validate, and import operations.

**FR12:** The CLI shall provide tool management with discovery, installation, configuration, testing, and registry operations.

**FR13:** The CLI shall enable LLM provider management with add, configure, test, set-default, and model listing capabilities.

**FR14:** The CLI shall include developer/debug features with logs viewing, debug mode execution, and version information.

**FR15:** The CLI shall maintain backward compatibility with existing agent execution workflows while providing enhanced interface.

### Non-Functional Requirements

**NFR1:** CLI startup time shall be under 200ms for simple commands to maintain responsive developer experience.

**NFR2:** The CLI shall gracefully handle network timeouts and provide meaningful error messages with recovery suggestions.

**NFR3:** All user inputs shall be validated with clear error messages and guidance for correction before execution.

**NFR4:** The CLI shall support cross-platform operation on Windows, macOS, and Linux environments.

**NFR5:** Plugin registration shall be secure and validate plugin integrity before loading to prevent malicious code execution.

**NFR6:** The CLI shall follow accessibility best practices with high contrast colors and screen reader compatibility.

**NFR7:** Configuration files shall be human-readable YAML format with inline documentation and validation.

**NFR8:** The CLI shall provide consistent command structure and naming conventions across all command groups.

**NFR9:** Error handling shall include appropriate exit codes for programmatic integration and CI/CD pipeline usage.

**NFR10:** The CLI shall support both interactive and non-interactive (batch) modes for different usage scenarios.
