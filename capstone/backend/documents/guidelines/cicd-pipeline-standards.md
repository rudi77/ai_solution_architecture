# CI/CD Pipeline Standards

## Pipeline Requirements

All services must have automated CI/CD pipelines that include:

### Build Stage
- Code compilation/transpilation
- Dependency installation
- Static analysis
- Security scanning

### Test Stage
- Unit tests with coverage reporting
- Integration tests
- End-to-end tests (where applicable)
- Performance tests (for critical services)

### Security Stage
- Dependency vulnerability scanning
- Container security scanning
- Static application security testing (SAST)
- License compliance checking

### Deploy Stage
- Automated deployment to staging
- Automated testing in staging
- Manual approval for production
- Blue-green or rolling deployments

## GitHub Actions Standards

### Workflow Structure
```yaml
name: CI/CD Pipeline
on:
  push:
    branches: [main, develop]
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Setup environment
      - name: Install dependencies
      - name: Run linting
      - name: Run tests
      - name: Upload coverage
  
  security:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Security scan
      - name: Dependency check
  
  build:
    needs: [test, security]
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Build container
      - name: Push to registry
```

### Required Workflow Features
- Run on pull requests and main branch pushes
- Use matrix builds for multiple environments
- Cache dependencies for faster builds
- Store build artifacts
- Generate and store test reports

## Docker Standards

### Multi-stage Builds
Always use multi-stage builds to minimize image size:

```dockerfile
# Build stage
FROM node:18-alpine AS builder
WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm ci --only=production

# Production stage
FROM node:18-alpine
WORKDIR /app
COPY --from=builder /app/node_modules ./node_modules
COPY . .
EXPOSE 3000
CMD ["npm", "start"]
```

### Security Requirements
- Run as non-root user
- Use official base images
- Keep images minimal
- Scan for vulnerabilities
- Use specific version tags (not latest)

## Deployment Standards

### Environment Strategy
- **Development**: Auto-deploy from feature branches
- **Staging**: Auto-deploy from develop branch
- **Production**: Manual deployment with approval

### Configuration Management
- Use environment variables for configuration
- Store secrets in secure key management
- Use different configurations per environment
- Never commit secrets to version control

### Health Checks
All services must implement:
- Liveness probes
- Readiness probes
- Startup probes (for slow-starting services)

### Monitoring and Logging
- Structured logging in JSON format
- Centralized log aggregation
- Application metrics collection
- Error tracking and alerting
- Performance monitoring

## Quality Gates

### Pre-deployment Checks
- All tests pass
- Code coverage > 80%
- Security scans pass
- Performance benchmarks met
- Documentation updated

### Post-deployment Verification
- Health checks pass
- Smoke tests pass
- Performance metrics normal
- Error rates within acceptable limits

## Rollback Strategy

### Automated Rollback Triggers
- Health check failures
- High error rates
- Performance degradation
- Manual trigger capability

### Rollback Process
- Immediate traffic routing to previous version
- Database migration rollback (if needed)
- Configuration rollback
- Notification to team
