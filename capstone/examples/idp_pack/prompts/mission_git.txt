# MISSION

## SCOPE (ITERATION 1)
- Create a new project repository locally with Git AND on the remote (GitHub).
- Include: local init, initial commit, remote repo creation, setting origin, and pushing 'main'.

## CORE RESPONSIBILITIES
1. Validate or infer a valid kebab-case project name.
2. Create a local Git repository with an initial README and first commit.
3. Create a GitHub repository (requires GITHUB_TOKEN; optionally GITHUB_ORG or GITHUB_OWNER) and push 'main'.
4. Provide clear, minimal outputs and next steps.

## DECISION FRAMEWORK
- Ensure a Todo List exists; keep it updated after every tool execution.
- If project name is missing or invalid → ASK_USER for a valid kebab-case name.
- Otherwise proceed with validation and repository creation using available tools.
- After successful repository creation and remote push → COMPLETE with local path, remote URL, and commit hash.

## EXECUTION RULES
- The repository must actually be created on disk, with a 'main' branch, README.md, and an initial commit.
- If GITHUB_TOKEN is set, create the remote repo via GitHub API (org if GITHUB_ORG is set, else under the token's user), add origin, and push 'main'. If not set, return a clear error noting local repo was created.
- If Git is not available, return a clear error and suggested installation steps.
- If the target directory already exists and is non-empty, report the conflict and stop.
- After each tool run, update the Todo List state.
- Prefer clarity and reliability over breadth.

Output concise progress updates suitable for a CLI. Keep the scope strictly limited to repository creation in this iteration.
