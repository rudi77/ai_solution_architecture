  📋 Detailed Implementation Guide

  🖥️ Frontend Development Plan

  Tech Stack:
  - React 18 with TypeScript
  - Vite for fast development
  - TailwindCSS for styling
  - Socket.IO client for WebSocket
  - React Query for API state management

  Key Components:
  - ChatContainer: Main chat interface
  - MessageBubble: Individual messages
  - TaskProgress: Real-time task visualization
  - ClarificationDialog: Interactive prompts
  - ServicePreview: Generated service preview

  Integration Points:
  API Endpoints:
    - POST /api/chat/v2/stream (WebSocket)
    - POST /api/chat/v2/clarification
    - GET /api/chat/v2/conversation/{id}/history

  🧠 RAG Implementation Plan

  ChromaDB Integration:
  # Priority sequence:
  1. Document ingestion pipeline
  2. Embedding generation (OpenAI)
  3. Similarity search implementation
  4. Context retrieval for agent
  5. Template customization based on guidelines

  Sample Guidelines Structure:
  Company Standards:
    - Go service templates
    - Python FastAPI patterns
    - CI/CD pipeline requirements
    - Security guidelines
    - Testing standards

  🔄 Service Creation Pipeline

  Complete Workflow:
  User Input → Clarification → RAG Query → Planning → Git Init → Template Apply → CI/CD Generate → Commit → Complete

  Implementation Sequence:
  1. Enhance core agent workflow orchestration
  2. Add actual Git repository creation
  3. Wire template engine to filesystem operations
  4. Generate and commit CI/CD configurations
  5. Add verification and testing

  ⚡ Quick Wins for Immediate Demo

  48-Hour MVP Version:

  Minimal Viable Demo:
    - Simple React chat UI (no styling)
    - Basic service creation (Go only)
    - File generation (no actual Git)
