‚óè üìã Google ADK Deep Integration Implementation Plan

  üéØ Vision: ADK as Core Orchestration Engine

  Transform the IDP Copilot from "ADK as optional add-on" to "ADK as the intelligent conversation driver" that manages the entire service creation lifecycle.

  üèóÔ∏è Phase 1: Foundation Restructuring (Week 1)

  1.1 Agent-Centric Architecture Redesign

  Current Problem: Agent exists as isolated utility function
  Solution: Make Agent the primary conversation controller

  # NEW: app/agent/core_agent.py
  class IDPAgent:
      def __init__(self, db_path: str, mcp_tools: List[MCPToolset]):
          self.agent = Agent(
              name="idp_copilot",
              model="gemini-2.0-flash",
              instruction=self._build_system_instruction(),
              tools=mcp_tools,
              memory=PersistentMemory(db_path)  # Custom memory implementation
          )
          self.db_path = db_path

      async def process_message(self, conversation_id: str, message: str) -> AsyncIterator[AgentEvent]:
          # Stream agent responses with proper event mapping

      async def handle_clarification(self, conversation_id: str, response: str) -> AsyncIterator[AgentEvent]:
          # Continue conversation with clarification context

  Tasks:
  - Create app/agent/core_agent.py with ADK-native conversation management
  - Implement PersistentMemory class that bridges ADK memory with SQLite
  - Design AgentEvent schema for streaming responses
  - Replace adk_adapter.py defensive coding with proper ADK lifecycle management

  1.2 MCP Tools Integration Overhaul

  Current Problem: MCP tools configured but not functionally integrated
  Solution: Build production-ready MCP toolsets for actual operations

  # NEW: app/mcp/toolsets/
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ git_operations.py      # Repo creation, commits, branching
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ filesystem_ops.py      # Template insertion, file management  
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ template_engine.py     # Language-specific scaffolding
  ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ cicd_generator.py      # Pipeline configuration generation

  Tasks:
  - Implement GitOperationsToolset with repo creation, cloning, commits
  - Build FilesystemToolset for template management and code generation
  - Create TemplateEngineToolset with language-specific scaffolding (Go, Python, Node.js)
  - Develop CICDToolset for GitHub Actions/GitLab CI pipeline generation
  - Wire all toolsets into core agent initialization

  üîÑ Phase 2: Conversation State Management (Week 2)

  2.1 Persistent Agent Memory

  Current Problem: No conversation continuity between requests
  Solution: Implement ADK-compatible memory persistence

  # NEW: app/agent/memory.py
  class ConversationMemory:
      """Bridge between ADK memory interface and SQLite persistence"""

      async def store_interaction(self, conversation_id: str, interaction: AgentInteraction):
          # Store user message, agent response, tool calls, results

      async def load_context(self, conversation_id: str) -> List[AgentInteraction]:
          # Reconstruct conversation history for agent context

      async def clear_context(self, conversation_id: str):
          # Clean conversation state

  Tasks:
  - Design AgentInteraction schema linking user input ‚Üí agent reasoning ‚Üí tool execution ‚Üí results
  - Extend SQLite schema with agent memory tables
  - Implement memory retrieval for conversation continuity
  - Add conversation context limits and summarization

  2.2 Real-time Agent State Streaming

  Current Problem: Mock events instead of actual agent responses
  Solution: True ADK streaming with rich event types

  # NEW: Agent event types for frontend
  @dataclass
  class AgentThinking:
      reasoning: str
      confidence: float

  @dataclass  
  class AgentToolCall:
      tool_name: str
      parameters: dict
      status: ToolCallStatus

  @dataclass
  class AgentClarification:
      question: str
      context: dict
      required_fields: List[str]

  Tasks:
  - Map ADK internal events to typed frontend events
  - Implement WebSocket streaming with agent reasoning visibility
  - Add tool execution progress tracking
  - Create clarification request/response flow

  üõ†Ô∏è Phase 3: Intelligent Workflow Orchestration (Week 3)

  3.1 Context-Aware Planning

  Current Problem: Simple task list generation without intelligence
  Solution: Agent-driven adaptive planning with RAG integration

  # Enhanced agent instruction with RAG context
  SYSTEM_INSTRUCTION = """
  You are an expert DevOps engineer helping create software services.

  AVAILABLE TOOLS:
  - git_ops: Create repos, manage branches, commits
  - filesystem: Read/write files, apply templates  
  - template_engine: Generate language-specific scaffolding
  - cicd_generator: Create CI/CD pipelines
  - rag_search: Query company guidelines and best practices

  WORKFLOW:
  1. Understand user requirements through clarifying questions
  2. Search company guidelines for relevant standards
  3. Plan step-by-step service creation approach

  üöÄ Migration Strategy

  1. Parallel Implementation: Build new agent system alongside existing
  2. Feature Flag: Toggle between old/new agent implementations
  3. Gradual Rollout: Start with simple workflows, expand complexity
  4. Rollback Plan: Keep existing deterministic fallback intact

  This plan transforms your IDP Copilot from a demo with ADK-flavoring into a true AI-native development assistant that leverages ADK's full capabilities for intelligent, stateful, tool-driven service     
   creation.
