# Success Criteria for AI Agents

This documentation enables AI agents to:

- ✅ **Navigate the codebase** using clear file references and module descriptions
- ✅ **Understand constraints** including platform dependencies and technical debt
- ✅ **Extend functionality** via the well-documented ToolSpec interface
- ✅ **Debug issues** using comprehensive logging and state persistence information  
- ✅ **Make informed decisions** about architecture changes based on current limitations
- ✅ **Follow established patterns** for consistency with existing codebase conventions

The IDP Copilot represents a sophisticated, working implementation of a ReAct agent system with real-world developer platform automation capabilities, while acknowledging the technical debt and constraints that come with rapid prototype development.
