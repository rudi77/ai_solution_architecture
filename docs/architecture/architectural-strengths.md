# Architectural Strengths

1. **Clear Separation of Concerns**: Well-defined boundaries between agent, tools, state, and API layers
2. **Extensible Tool System**: Easy addition of new capabilities via `ToolSpec` interface
3. **Provider Abstraction**: LLM-agnostic design supporting multiple AI providers
4. **Plan-First Transparency**: Users can see and interrupt agent plans before execution
5. **Comprehensive Observability**: Built-in Prometheus metrics and OpenTelemetry tracing
6. **Real-World Focus**: Practical tools for actual IDP workflows (Git, CI/CD, K8s)
7. **State Recovery**: Session persistence enables agent recovery after crashes
