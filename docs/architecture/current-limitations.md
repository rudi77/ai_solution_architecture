# Current Limitations

1. **Platform Dependency**: Windows PowerShell-specific development environment
2. **Scalability Constraints**: File-based storage and single-process architecture
3. **Security Gaps**: No authentication, authorization, or secure secret management
4. **Concurrency Limitations**: Single-threaded tool execution and session handling
5. **Deployment Complexity**: Manual setup with multiple configuration steps
6. **Testing Gaps**: Real API dependencies make testing expensive and unreliable
7. **Documentation Gaps**: While comprehensive, documentation is scattered across multiple files
