  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'No sensitive data in logs (mission preview only, max 100 chars). No new attack surfaces introduced.'
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Reset operation O(1) complexity with ~5-10ms overhead. Async/await properly used. Mission preview slicing prevents memory issues.'
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Graceful error handling on state save failure. Execution continues even if reset fails. No resource leaks. State consistency maintained.'
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Minimal invasiveness (35 LOC). Clear variable names. Comprehensive structured logging. Backward compatible. Docstring updated.'

code_quality_highlights:
  - 'Clean architecture: Reset logic inserted at perfect location without disrupting existing flow'
  - 'Smart string slicing with defensive programming: self.mission[:100] if self.mission else None'
  - 'State surgery precision: self.state.pop("todolist_id", None) removes only what is needed'
  - 'Fail-safe pattern: State save wrapped in try/except with logging but continues execution'
  - 'Complete type annotations including Optional[str] for nullable fields'
  - 'Event-driven design enables CLI feedback without coupling'

test_architecture_assessment:
  strengths:
    - 'Comprehensive coverage: 5 tests covering happy path, edge cases, and backward compatibility'
    - 'Well-named tests using "Should..." convention'
    - 'Proper mocking: Clean use of AsyncMock for async methods, MagicMock for loggers'
    - 'All tests follow AAA pattern (Arrange-Act-Assert)'
    - 'Events collected and inspected (async iterator handling correct)'
    - 'Logger calls verified with exact parameter matching'
    - 'Explicit backward compatibility test ensures single-mission agents unaffected'
