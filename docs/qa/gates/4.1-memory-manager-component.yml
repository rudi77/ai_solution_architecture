  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'No security vulnerabilities. API keys via environment variables, local storage only, graceful error handling prevents information disclosure.'
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Embedding caching reduces API calls. Retrieval < 200ms for 1000 memories (meets AC16). Async operations prevent blocking.'
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Robust error handling, graceful degradation when disabled, dual-storage approach (ChromaDB + JSON fallback) ensures reliability.'
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Clean code structure, comprehensive docstrings, follows StateManager patterns, excellent test coverage, well-documented.'
