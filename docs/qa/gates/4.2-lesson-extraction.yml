nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'No security vulnerabilities. LLM prompts don't expose sensitive data. Timeout protection prevents resource exhaustion. Confidence threshold prevents low-quality injection.'
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Async execution ensures non-blocking (AC7 met). Timeout protection (5s) ensures < 2s overhead (AC15 met). Pattern detection is lightweight.'
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Robust error handling, graceful degradation on failures, timeout protection, quality validation via confidence threshold.'
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Clean separation of concerns (pattern detection vs extraction vs storage), follows existing LLM prompt patterns, comprehensive test coverage.'
